Overview of the Project      

Project: Movie Rating Prediction with Python       

Objective:        
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, actors, and other relevant attributes. The model aims to provide insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and to accurately predict ratings for new or unseen movies.

Key Activities:         
1.Dataset Selection: Choose a dataset relevant to the problem domain or area of interest.       
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values through imputation or removal,Correct data types if necessary,Remove duplicates and irrelevant data      
3. Feature Engineering:Create new features that may improve the model's performance, such as family size, title extraction from the name, or grouping ages into bins.         
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distribution of movie ratings and other features.         
5.Model Selection: Choose appropriate regression models for predicting movie ratings. Common choices          
6.Model Interpretation:Analyze feature importance to understand which factors most strongly influence movie ratings.        
7. Data Visualization: Visualize findings with histograms, scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps using matplotlib and seaborn.     

Technologies Used:        
1.Python: Programming Language      
2.pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.      
3. numpy: for numerical operations and array handling.      
4. matplotlib: for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.      
5. seaborn: for statistical data visualization.
